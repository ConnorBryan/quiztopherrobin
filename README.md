## An example trivia application.

### Description
This application is a simple quiz with varying question count and difficulty. After answering the questions, results are displayed.

### Why I built it
This miniature application serves as a showcase for bare-minimum React capability. Some aspects of this application include a standard container/components directory dichotomy (although the lack of an external state management solution means no containers exist), pretter-compliant code formatting, a series of unit tests for each component (except App itself, as well as the fetchQuestions service, which I would do were I to continue to flesh out this project), scalability via a configuration file, maintainability via re-use of common themes, and best practices as I know them by heart.
